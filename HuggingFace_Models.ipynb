He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help them and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous speech beginning with the words: \"Sisters and brothers of America ...\" while introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He made such an impression there that an American newspaper described him as \"an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament\".\n",
